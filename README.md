Here is the breakdown of the steps carried out in the provided Google Colab notebook for analyzing the IMDB top 1000 movies dataset:
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
•	Importing Libraries: Necessary libraries like pandas and NumPy are imported for data manipulation and analysis.
•	Loading Data: The IMDB dataset (imdb_top_1000.csv) is uploaded and read into a pandas DataFrame called df.
•	Data Overview: df.head() is used to display the first few rows of the dataset, providing a glimpse of its structure.
•	Data Information: df.info() is used to get basic information about the dataset, like the number of rows, columns, and data types of each column.
•	Checking for Missing Values: df.isnull().sum() is used to identify columns with missing values, highlighting potential data quality issues.

2. Handling Missing Values
•	Gross Column:
o	The 'Gross' column, representing movie earnings, is converted to numeric format using pd.to_numeric(), handling currency symbols and commas.
o	Missing values in the 'Gross' column are filled with 0 temporarily.
o	The mean value of the 'Gross' column is calculated and stored.
o	Finally, the 0 values (representing missing values) are replaced with the calculated mean value, ensuring data completeness.
•	Meta_score Column:
o	Similar to the 'Gross' column, missing values in the 'Meta_score' column are initially filled with 0.
o	The mean value of the 'Meta_score' column is calculated.
o	The 0 values are replaced with the calculated mean value, addressing missing data in this column.

3. Data Analysis and Exploration
•	Correlation Analysis:
o	Numeric columns are selected from the DataFrame.
o	The corr() method is used to calculate the correlation between these numeric columns, revealing potential relationships between variables.
•	Finding Top Movies:
o	Movies are sorted based on 'Gross' and 'IMDB_Rating' columns in descending order.
o	The top 10 movies in terms of 'Gross' and 'IMDB_Rating' are displayed, showcasing the highest-earning and top-rated movies.
In summary, the notebook focuses on loading, cleaning, and exploring the IMDB top 1000 movies dataset. It addresses missing values, analyzes correlations between variables, and identifies top-performing movies based on specific criteria. The code provides a clear and structured approach to data analysis, enabling insights into the movie dataset.
